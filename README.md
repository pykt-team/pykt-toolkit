pyKT is a python library build upon PyTorch to train deep learning based knowledge tracing models. The library consists of a standardized set of integrated data preprocessing procedures on more than 7 popular datasets across different domains, 5 detailed prediction scenarios, more than 10 frequently compared DLKT approaches for transparent and extensive experiments. More details about pyKT can see our [website](https://pykt.org/) and [docs](https://pykt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html).
